# calculator_react_project
I have developed this alongside a tutorial and also partially attempting to create some elements myself.
Although I am happy with it, I do want to fix an error where:
-the DEL key doesn't function.

Next, I aim to improve this calculator to include more complex elements such as:
-PI
-Trigonometry
-BIDMAS rules

Then further down the line I want to create a website for maths students in React where they will be able to answer maths questions.
They will be fetched from a DB and the student will be able to select his examboard and level of study to perfectly match his studies.
This then could be upgraded to include specific topics so students can revise what they struggle with.
